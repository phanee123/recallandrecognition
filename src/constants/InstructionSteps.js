            Our learning experiences or information about events, things, and the people we encounter are retained or 
            stored or recorded in our memory. How much is retained and how long the retained material lasts depends on
            various factors like learning, motivation, forgetting, etc. There are many ways of testing a personâ€™s memory.
            The most common methods are recall & recognition.
            </p>
            <p>
            Recall involves the verbal reproduction or repetition of learnt material. In free recall, chunks, or pieces of 
            learnt material may be recalled freely without following any specific order. Some may reproduce the answer
            instantly, i.e., without following a specific order.
            </p>
            <p>
            In recognition some sort of a suggestion or clue is presented along with originally perceived objects and the
            individual has to pick out the objects he has perceived initially
